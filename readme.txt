3 Known issues
--------------
Not real issues, but it's important to know this:
- Due to game limitations, the lastest 9 buses are unable to overtake others:
- Only the first 2 buses can pass over other vehicles (of the same size or shorter in lenght).
- In the same way that only the first 2 buses are the ones that can get in and out of bus terminals, making inversion sharp curves in one square of terrain map.
- The last 9 vehicles, can only perform service at street/road stops. (Drive-Trough)
- The default (Vanilla) Bus vehicles are disabled with this pack active. (Not a replacement, but it works as if it was...).

For future issues, please report on my github repository.
